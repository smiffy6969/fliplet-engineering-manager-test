### Data Processor

I use cursor at present anyway, but it can get in the way alot so only used auto complete for replacing like names such as user. to users[i].
I used google to search for efficency saving on map over set.
wanted to work promise.all into equation for some parallel gains, and simple batching put in to stop memory issues with lage datasets (could have put a limit in too i guess).

### Rate Limiter

I had to read this several times...

"Implement a middleware to **limit API requests per tenant (organization).**"

it already does works as a middleware, and not asking for it to be improved... implement, as in show how ot use it???

again no prompts needed, just implementing with express use which next passes on to the next middleware in the express chain

### Drag and Drop

Again, a little confused....

"Implement a **drag-and-drop UI** that allows users to add UI components to a web page preview."

this componnet already works, just needs adding a vue app. Does not say improve, and it does to the letter whats asked, implement it? as in add it to a basic vue app?

rather than butcher this file which works as described, i will implement and pull it in to a basic app in the frontend folder

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

follow the promtps and out it pops... adjusted the paths to fit in flat folder and added in the drag and drop component

this would be better organised in a full project setup structure.
